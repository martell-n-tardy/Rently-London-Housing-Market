# Rently - London Housing Market
In this case study I will be exploring a hypothetical business case for the company Rently (https://use.rently.com/), which developed a patented self-touring technology that automates property tours of a home or apartment. Rently is seeking to expand their customer base to the London market by the end of 2023. In order to do this, Rently has created a proposal for a data-driven approach to this challenge and has provided data from London Datastore: https://data.london.gov.uk/. Rently is planning to begin trial runs of their service in five selected boroughs of London by the second quarter of 2022, so time is of the essence.
